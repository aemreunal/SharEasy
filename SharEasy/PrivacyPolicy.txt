SharEasy app, in it's servers, stores only the items you share, in which the following information is available:

	1) Facebook User ID of the sharing person, which, under the Facebook terms, can be stored for non-financial uses, which includes this case.
	2) The description of the shared item, which the user enters before sharing.
	3) The URL of the shared item, which is the URL to the SkyDrive file the user chose to upload.
	4) The date of the shared item, which is the date the item is shared.
	5) The name of the shared item, which is the name of the file the user chose to upload.

Apart from these items, NOTHING is stored in SharEasy's servers. No login information is kept, recoreded, or otherwise transferred outside of 
the official Facebook Login or the Live Login, implemented to SharEasy.

Everything you choose to share is uploaded to the Public folder of your SkyDrive, which means anyone can view it. Deleting a shared item from 
SharEasy only means that you delete the REFERENCE to the item you uploaded, visible to other users of SharEasy. The actual file is NOT deleted
and will still be accessible to anyone who has the link to it.
